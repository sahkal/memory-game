**MEMORY GAME Beta**


**MEMORY GAME Beta** is a browser-based online educational game that requires a player to match similar icons For example, 16 cards; Composed of 8 different icons scrambled randomly which are to matched by the player.
#### RULES

How The Game Works:
-   The player flips one card over to reveal its hidden icon.
-   The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same icon.
-   If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
-   If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
-   The above four steps are equivalent to 1 move.

The game ends when the  **timer**  goes to zero or player wins by matching all the cards! The number of  **moves**  a player took to win the game determines the  **star rating**., lesser the moves more star ratings are assigned to the player.
